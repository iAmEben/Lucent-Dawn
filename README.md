This is my "hello world" for android and its my first project. It is a very simple torchlight application which turns android torch on and off and doesnt require permission.

## The design is simple it has two themes a dark and a light theme.

## Switching between themes is easy 
You just need to press the toggle button and its done.
Also the button clicks have media sounds to make the clicks more realistic.
